**CSS Naming Conventions**

To mitigate possible overlap/redundancy in class/ID naming conventions, add a preface to your ID/ClassName based on what you're working on.  
for example:

instead of className="strength-equipment", write it as className=-"HPstrength-equipment".  the "HP" would delineate this is a HomePage feature class.  

This will keep us from duplicating class/ID names across the app.
